## Project 1: Word Correction
### Description
Word Correction (Sửa lỗi chính tả) is a basic application of natural language processing aimed at correcting misspelled words. The application takes an input word from the user and suggests the correct spelling. For simplicity, the Levenshtein distance metric is used to measure the minimum edit distance between two words.

### Features
- Load a vocabulary from a file
- Calculate Levenshtein distance between input word and each word in the vocabulary
- Suggest the word with the smallest edit distance
- Simple user interface using Streamlit

## Project 2: Object Detection
### Description
Object Detection is a crucial application of image processing, aiming to detect bounding boxes containing objects in images. Users can upload an image, and the application will highlight detected objects using a pre-trained DNN model from the OpenCV library.

### Features
- Upload an image
- Detect objects using a pre-trained MobileNetSSD model
- Display bounding boxes around detected objects
- Simple user interface using Streamlit

## Project 3: Chatbot
### Description
Chatbot is a simple application that uses HugChat and Streamlit to create an interactive chatbot. The application allows users to log in with their Hugging Face credentials and interact with a language model.

### Features
- Login with Hugging Face credentials
- Interactive chat interface
- Simple user interface using Streamlit
